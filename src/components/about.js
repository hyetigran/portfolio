          Since graduating with a degree in finance, the three questions I
          repeatedly ask myself -- Who are you? Where are you going? & Why? --
          helped guide me to realize my goal of building great products instead
          of simply consuming them. After a year of honing my skills, I'm
          determined and ready to help you build great products together.
